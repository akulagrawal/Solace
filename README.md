## Solace - Running scenarios before they occur

No one likes their city to fall prey to a natural calamity and it is worse if the city is unprepared for that. City planners surely do a great task when it comes out to plan the locality like the sewage system, roads, hospitals or traffic management. One thing which they are ill - equipped with is to simulate how the city's infrastructure will react when a uncalling natural calamity knocks on the door.

Solace is the answer to this, we are building a cloud based tool which help the city planners leverage out the modern compute power to get a better insight as to how the city will stand in front of an earthquake or flood or any other such natural angers.

Which part of the city is better equipped than the rest or how does the city stands in front of other cities ?<br/>
How much time will the rescuers take to reach an affected area ?<br/>
Do we have the adeqaute medical infrastructure <br/>
Do we have crowd control measures, in case of untowards incident ?<br/>

These are only some of the questions which Solace tries to answer.
